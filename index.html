          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p id="paragraph">
            Registered Architect (BORAQS), Member of the Architectural
            Association of Kenya (AAK)
            <br />
            Partner & Principal Architect, Arplad Architects Ltd – Ongata
            Rongai, Kajiado County
            <br />
            With over 15 years of architectural experience, I have had the
            privilege of shaping a diverse range of projects across Kenya — from
            residential and commercial buildings to university campuses and
            renovation works.
            <br />
            A graduate of the University of Nairobi, my design philosophy
            centers on sustainability, functionality, cost-effectiveness, and
            durability. I believe good architecture should not only look
            beautiful but also serve its users efficiently and stand the test of
            time.
            <br />
            Some of the projects I’ve led or contributed to include the KWFT
            Centre and KMA Centre in Upperhill, Nairobi; ILU University Campus
            in Kitengela; and the University of Nairobi Campus in Kasarani.
            <br />
            Beyond architecture, I enjoy exploring DIY projects — from carpentry
            and welding to plumbing and electrical work — experiences that keep
            me grounded in the practical side of building. I’m also passionate
            about traveling and photography, which continually inspire my
            creative process and appreciation for design in everyday life.
